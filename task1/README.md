# Task 1 Completion

I have successfully completed all the steps for **Task 1**.  

- Created a GitHub repository named **"samsung-riscv"** and thoroughly documented the entire process.  
- Installed the **RISC-V toolchain**.  
- Compiled and executed a **C program for summing numbers** using both **GCC** and **RISC-V GCC**.  
- Generated and analyzed the **assembly code** using `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump`.  
- Captured and uploaded **all snapshots with date/time** to the repository.  
- Provided **comprehensive documentation** for the entire process.  

The repository now contains all necessary files, including source code, assembly output, and supporting documentation.
