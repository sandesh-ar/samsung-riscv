# SPIKE Simulation and Compiler Optimization Analysis  

I watched the **SPIKE simulation video** and observed the impact of **-O1** and **-Ofast** compiler optimization flags on performance.  

## Steps Performed:  

1. **Developed a Calculator Program**  
   - Wrote a **simple calculator program in C** to perform basic arithmetic operations.  

2. **Compilation**  
   - Compiled the program using both the **GCC compiler** and the **RISC-V GCC compiler**.  

3. **Generated RISC-V Object Dumps**  
   - Created object dumps for both **-O1** and **-Ofast** optimization levels.  

4. **SPIKE Execution & Debugging**  
   - Used **SPIKE** to execute the **RISC-V assembly code**.  
   - Performed **debugging** to analyze and compare the **RISC-V object dumps**.  

## Key Observations:  
- Compared the differences in the **generated assembly code** for **-O1** and **-Ofast**.  
- Evaluated the impact of optimizations on **program performance**.  

This analysis provided insights into how different compiler optimizations affect **execution speed and code efficiency** in RISC-V architecture
